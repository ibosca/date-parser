# PetsApp tech test

## The task
We want to be able easily construct dates using a shorthand syntax that looks like `'now-1d/d'`. You might have seen something like this before if you've used Elasticsearch range queries. Please create two functions, one called `parse` which will take a string like the above and return a date, and another called `stringify` which will take a date, and return a string like the above.

Things to know:
- Please don't use any date or time related libraries
- All times are in UTC
- Follow the process you would if implementing this in real life

### Signatures
```typescript
type DateString = String;

fn parse(datestring: DateString): Date;
fn stringify(date: Date): DateString;
```

## Glossary
### Units
This is an exhaustive list of units of time:
```
d day
M month
y year
h hour
m minute
s second
w week
```

### Operators
This is an exhaustive list of operators:
```
- subtract
+ add
/{unit} round to closest unit
```

## Examples
Given the current date and time is `2020-05-01T00:00:00.000Z`:
```
now-1y/y  -> 2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z - now minus one year rounded to the nearest year
now/y     -> 2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z - now rounded to the nearest year
now-1d    -> 2020-04-30T00:00:00.000Z - now minus 1 day
now+1d    -> 2020-05-02T00:00:00.000Z - now add 1 day
now-4d-4h -> 2020-04-26T20:00:00.000Z - now minus four days and four hours
```
